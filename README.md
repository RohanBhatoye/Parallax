## Project Description
This project is a parallax scrolling website that showcases the 7 Wonders of the World using HTML and CSS. The main features include:

1. **Parallax Effect**: Utilizes `background-attachment: fixed` in CSS for a visually engaging parallax scrolling effect across sections representing each wonder.
2. **Responsive Design**: Implements media queries to adjust text size and padding for optimal viewing on various screen sizes.
4. **Stylized Text**: Text elements are centrally positioned and styled with background colors, padding, and uppercase transformation for readability and aesthetic appeal.
